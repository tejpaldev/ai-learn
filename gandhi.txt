I must have been about seven when my father left Porbandar for Rajkot to 
become a member of the Rajasthanik Court. There I was put into a primary 
school, and I can well recollect those days, including the names and other 
particulars of the teachers who taught me. As at Porbandar, so here, there is 
hardly anything to note about my studies. I could only have been a mediocre 
student. From this school I went to the suburban school and thence to the high 
school, having already reached my twelfth year. I do not remember having ever 
told a lie, during this short period, either to my teachers or to my school
mates. I used to be very shy and avoided all company. My books and my lessons 
were my sole companions. To be at school at the stroke of the hour and to run 
back home as soon as the school closed–that was my daily habit. I literally ran 
back, because I could not bear to talk to anybody. I was even afraid lest 
anyone should poke fun at me.  
There is an incident which occurred at the examination during my first year at 
the high school and which is worth recording. Mr. Giles, the Educational 
Inspector, had come on a visit of inspection. He had set us five words to write 
as a spelling exercise. One of the words was 'kettle'. I had mis-spelt it. The 
teacher tried to prompt me with the point of his boot, but I would not be 
prompted. It was beyond me to see that he wanted me to copy the spelling 
from my neighbour's slate, for I had thought that the teacher was there to 
supervise us against copying. The result was that all the boys, except myself, 
were found to have spelt every word correctly. Only I had been stupid. The 
teacher tried later to bring this stupidity home to me, but without effect. I 
never could learn the art of 'copying'.
